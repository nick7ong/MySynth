# Terminal Synth (C++)
A simple terminal synth using OneLoneCoder’s public directory "olcNoiseMaker.h”
This synth allows you to output different waves (i.e. sine, square, sawtooth, and any other wave equation) and mix and match them to make a unique sound
This was a great opportunity apply all of my knowledge of wave behavior and sound physics into very basic “DSP” code
